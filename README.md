# -RaisinClassify-A-Decision-Tree-Classifier-for-Raisin-Varieties-
Welcome to RaisinClassifyâ€”a project that implements a Decision Tree Classifier to differentiate between Kecimen and Besni raisin varieties using morphological features extracted from images. This project leverages the Scikit-learn library for building the model and evaluates its performance through various metrics.
